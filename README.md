# Keylogger Project

## Description

This project involves writing a Python script to log key presses using the `pynput` library. The script logs each key press and writes it to a file named `keylog.txt`.

## Usage

To use the keylogger script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KeyloggerProject.git
    cd KeyloggerProject
    ```

2. Ensure you have the `pynput` library installed:
    ```sh
    pip install pynput
    ```

3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python keylogger.py
    ```

4. The script will start logging key presses and save them to `keylog.txt` in the same directory. To stop the script, press the `Esc` key.

### Example

Here is an example interaction with the script:

Key.space
'a'
'b'
'c'
Key.esc
